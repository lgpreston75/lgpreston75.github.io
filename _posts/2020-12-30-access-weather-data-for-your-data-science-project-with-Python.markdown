# Run Streamlit from Docker Container
streamlit <https://www.streamlit.io/>) is a great package for building quick data apps in Python. Also checkout <https://awesome-streamlit.readthedocs.io/> which has some great examples and tips on getting up and running.


This post will demonstrate how to run a simple "Hello World" streamlit app from a Docker container and as such will assume basic Docker knowledge. By using Docker, you not only have a clean environment to work with but you can also very easily deploy your new app on a cloud service like [Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/container-instances/).
