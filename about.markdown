Hi, I‚Äôm Llion! I've been doing data science for a few years now and thought it would be good to start sharing some of the things I've found useful or interesting.  

I've got a background in geospatial data, particularly satellite imagery, but have more recently been applying many of the same techniques in an ecommerce context. In my current role, my time is fairly equally split between writing SQL, building machine learning pipelines and building dashboards. 

I'm generally a Python user and as such most of my posts will probably include at least a little bit of Python üêç.

In my free time I love cycling, so I can find a way to incorporate any references to two wheels I will! 

I hope you find something interesting, please feel free to get in touch: <llion.preston@gmail.com>
